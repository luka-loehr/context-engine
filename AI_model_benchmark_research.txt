    1 OpenAI: GPT‑5 Family

    
    Official release &amp; pricing

    OpenAI announced GPT‑5 on 7 August 2025 via its developer blog. The model is available through ChatGPT and as an API in three sizes—gpt‑5, gpt‑5‑mini and gpt‑5‑nano[1]. The API pricing is tiered: gpt‑5 costs $1.25/1M input tokens and $10/1M output tokens, gpt‑5‑mini costs $0.25/$2 and gpt‑5‑nano costs $0.05/$0.40[2]. All three variants support a 272k input + 128k output reasoning window (400k total tokens)[3].

    
    
    Performance benchmarks and speed

    OpenAI’s benchmark table shows that GPT‑5 leads on most reasoning and multimodal tests, with gradually reduced scores in the mini and nano variants. On the SWE‑bench Verified coding benchmark, GPT‑5 achieves 74.9 %, mini 71.0 % and nano 54.7 %[2][4]. Latency measurements from an independent technical review report approximate first‑token latency and throughput: gpt‑5 ≈ 9.98 s latency / 38.35 t/s throughput, gpt‑5‑mini ≈ 4.53 s / 57.96 t/s and gpt‑5‑nano ≈ 3.13 s / 91.92 t/s[5]. Thus the mini and nano models are faster but sacrifice some accuracy.

    
    
    Strengths and weaknesses

    GPT‑5 (base) – the most capable reasoning/coding model, delivering state‑of‑the‑art results on coding (74.9 % SWE‑bench Verified) and reasoning benchmarks[6]. Supports extended thinking via reasoning_effort parameter with values from minimal to high[7][8]. Weakness: slower and more expensive than smaller versions.

    GPT‑5‑mini – balances accuracy with speed and cost. It achieves almost the same coding performance (71 %) at roughly half the latency, making it suitable for interactive applications. Weakness: slightly lower reasoning capability and still moderate cost.

    GPT‑5‑nano – optimized for high‑throughput, low‑latency tasks and cost‑sensitive use cases. Throughput ~91.9 tokens/s and cheapest price per token[9]. Weakness: significant drop in coding performance and reasoning depth.

    
    
    Recommended use cases

    OpenAI recommends GPT‑5 for agentic coding, complex reasoning, long‑horizon tasks and multi‑tool workflows. The mini and nano versions are recommended for interactive chat, high‑frequency retrieval and batch processing where cost and speed matter[1][8].

    
    
    Technical details

    All variants share the 400k token context window (272 k input + 128 k output)[3] and support parallel tool calls, custom tools and verbosity/reasoning effort parameters for controlling output length and thinking depth[1][10]. A lower reasoning_effort can return faster, but less reasoned answers.

    3 xAI: Grok Models

    
    Release &amp; pricing

    Grok Code Fast 1 – Launched Aug 28 2025 as xAI’s first coding‑optimized model. It uses a 256 K token context window and supports function calling and structured outputs[34]. Pricing: $0.20/1M input tokens and $1.50/1M output tokens with discounted caching rates[35].

    Grok 4 Fast – Announced Sept 19 2025 as a cost‑efficient version of Grok 4. It combines reasoning and non‑reasoning modes in one model and introduces two API endpoints—grok‑4‑fast‑reasoning and grok‑4‑fast‑non‑reasoning—which can be toggled via system prompts[36]. Context window is 2 million tokens[37]. Pricing: $0.20–0.40/1M input tokens and $0.50–1.00/1M output tokens depending on reasoning mode[38].

    
    
    Benchmarks, speed &amp; reasoning

    Grok Code Fast 1 – Achieves 70.8 % on SWE‑bench Verified (internal evaluation) and processes roughly 160–190 tokens/s[39][40]. It’s optimized for agentic coding tasks, bug fixes and refactoring[41]. Weakness: limited reasoning depth compared with larger models due to its lightweight transformer architecture[39].

    Grok 4 Fast – Performs comparably to Grok 4 across benchmarks while using 40 % fewer reasoning tokens and offers improved agentic tool use[37][42]. The unified architecture allows toggling between reasoning and quick‑response modes; reasoning mode reduces hallucinations and sycophancy at some cost to latency, while non‑reasoning returns answers faster[36]. According to analyses, the model can deliver ~227 tokens/s and uses reasoning budgets more efficiently.

    
    
    Strengths &amp; weaknesses

    grok‑code‑fast‑1 – Specializes in coding; fast and cost‑efficient with high throughput. Weakness: smaller context (256 K) and lower reasoning depth; less suited for complex multi‑step reasoning[39].

    grok‑4‑fast‑reasoning – Uses the unified Grok 4 Fast model with reasoning turned on. Offers deep reasoning and reduced hallucination, at higher cost and slightly slower speed[36]. Suitable for complex queries and tasks requiring chain‑of‑thought.

    grok‑4‑fast‑non‑reasoning – Same base model but with reasoning suppressed. Delivers the fastest responses and lower cost but with less explicit reasoning; recommended for quick answers and summarization[43].

    
    
    Recommended use cases

    grok‑code‑fast‑1 – Agentic coding assistants, bug fixing, refactoring and code generation across diverse languages[40]. 256K context window supports large codebases.

    grok‑4‑fast‑reasoning – Research agents, complex retrieval, planning and tasks needing deep chain‑of‑thought; also for search and multi‑hop question answering[37][44].

    grok‑4‑fast‑non‑reasoning – Latency‑sensitive chatbots, quick summarization, classification and tasks where reasoning isn’t necessary; choose this mode to save tokens and cost[43].

    
    
    Technical details

    Context window – grok‑code‑fast‑1 supports 256 K tokens[34]; both Grok 4 Fast variants support 2 M tokens[37].

    Reasoning control – Grok 4 Fast unifies reasoning and non‑reasoning weights; developers steer via system prompts or choose the reasoning vs non‑reasoning endpoints[36].

    Price differences – grok‑4‑fast‑non‑reasoning is slightly cheaper (starts at $0.20 input/$0.50 output per million tokens) compared with the reasoning mode (up to $0.40/$1.00)[38].
