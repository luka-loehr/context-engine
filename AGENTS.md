# Sample AI Coding Assistant Project AGENTS.md\n\nThis AGENTS.md file provides comprehensive guidance for AI coding agents working on this project. It covers setup, development practices, testing, and contribution workflows to ensure consistent and efficient collaboration.\n\n## Project Overview\n\nThis project is a sample repository designed for AI coding assistants to demonstrate best practices in documentation generation. The architecture is minimal, serving as a template for more complex applications. It uses Node.js for backend logic and includes placeholder files for configuration, scripts, and documentation. The purpose is to provide a foundation for AI agents to analyze, extend, and maintain codebases with clear guidelines.\n\nKey components:\n- **Core Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)\n- **Structure**: Root-level configuration files (e.g., package.json), src/ directory for source code, tests/ for unit tests\n- **Dependencies**: Standard npm packages for development tools like ESLint, Jest, and Prettier\n- **Architecture Pattern**: Modular, with separation of concerns for utilities, services, and entry points\n\nAI agents should focus on maintaining modularity, ensuring all changes align with the project's goal of serving as an educational template for automated code analysis.\n\n## Setup commands\n\nTo get started with development, follow these steps. All commands assume you have Node.js (v14+) and npm installed.\n\n1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**:\n   ```\n   git clone <repository-url>\n   cd sample-ai-project\n   npm install\n   ```\n   This installs all production and development dependencies listed in `package.json`.\n\n2. **Environment Setup**:\n   - Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`\n   - Configure any required variables (e.g., API keys if applicable; none in this sample).\n\n3. **Start Development Server**:\n   ```\n   npm run dev\n   ```\n   This launches the development server with hot reloading (using nodemon). The app runs on `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n4. **Build for Production**:\n   ```\n   npm run build\n   ```\n   Compiles the code into a production-ready bundle in the `dist/` directory.\n\n5. **Run in Production Mode**:\n   ```\n   npm start\n   ```\n\nIf issues arise, check `package.json` scripts for additional commands and ensure your Node version matches the requirements in `.nvmrc` (if present).\n\n## Code style\n\nThis project follows modern JavaScript standards to ensure readability and maintainability. AI agents must adhere to these conventions when making changes.\n\n- **Language and Version**: ES6+ JavaScript (transpiled with Babel if needed). Use `const` for constants, `let` for variables, and avoid `var`.\n- **Module System**: ES modules (import/export syntax). Use absolute imports where possible, e.g., `import { utils } from './src/utils/index.js';`.\n- **Naming Conventions**:\n  - Variables/Functions: camelCase (e.g., `processData`).\n  - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `DataProcessor`).\n  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`).\n  - Files: kebab-case (e.g., `data-processor.js`).\n- **Import Patterns**:\n  - Group imports: Standard libraries first, then third-party, then local.\n  - Example:\n    ```js\n    import fs from 'fs';\n    import lodash from 'lodash';\n    import { config } from '../config.js';\n    ```\n  - Avoid relative paths longer than 2 levels; use aliases if configured in jsconfig.json.\n- **Code Organization**:\n  - Keep functions under 50 lines; break into smaller, focused modules.\n  - Use async/await over promises for readability.\n  - Follow single responsibility principle: one file, one concern.\n  - Comments: JSDoc for public APIs; inline for complex logic.\n\nEnforce styles with ESLint (`npm run lint`) and Prettier (`npm run format`). Run these before committing.\n\n## Dev environment tips\n\nOptimize your development workflow with these tools and commands. AI agents can automate repetitive tasks using these.\n\n- **Common Development Commands** (from `package.json`):\n  - `npm run lint`: Check code style with ESLint.\n  - `npm run format`: Auto-format with Prettier.\n  - `npm run type-check`: Run TypeScript checks (if using TS; otherwise, skip).\n  - `npm run clean`: Remove build artifacts (`rm -rf dist/ node_modules/.cache`).\n\n- **Build Processes**:\n  - Development: Incremental builds with `npm run dev`.\n  - Production: Full build with minification (`npm run build`).\n  - Watch Mode: Enabled in dev script for real-time updates.\n\n- **Environment Setup**:\n  - Use nvm for Node version management: `nvm use` (based on `.nvmrc`).\n  - IDE Recommendations: VS Code with extensions for ESLint, Prettier, and GitLens.\n  - Debugging: Use `node --inspect` or VS Code debugger for breakpoints.\n  - Logging: Use console.log for dev; switch to a logger like Winston in prod.\n\n- **Common Pitfalls**:\n  - Ensure `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules`, `.env`, and `dist/`.\n  - For AI agents: When generating code, validate with `npm test` immediately.\n\nMonitor performance with tools like Node Clinic if the project scales.\n\n## Testing instructions\n\nTesting is crucial for reliability. This project uses Jest for unit and integration tests, aiming for 80%+ coverage.\n\n- **Test Structure**:\n  - Tests located in `__tests__/` directories alongside source files or in a top-level `tests/` folder.\n  - Unit tests: Focus on individual functions (e.g., `utils.test.js`).\n  - Integration tests: Cover module interactions (e.g., API endpoints).\n  - Use `describe`/`it` blocks with `expect` assertions.\n\n- **How to Run Tests**:\n  ```\n  npm test\n  ```\n  Runs all tests with coverage report. For specific files: `npm test -- utils.test.js`.\n\n- **Additional Commands**:\n  - `npm run test:watch`: Interactive watch mode for TDD.\n  - `npm run test:coverage`: Generate detailed coverage report (threshold: 80%).\n  - `npm run test:e2e`: Run end-to-end tests (if Cypress or similar is set up; not in sample).\n\n- **Coverage Requirements**:\n  - Branches: 80%, Functions: 80%, Lines: 80%.\n  - Enforced in CI via `jest --coverage --coverageReporters=lcov`.\n\n- **CI/CD Processes**:\n  - GitHub Actions (or similar): Runs `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run build` on PRs.\n  - Failures block merges; review coverage reports in CI logs.\n  - For AI agents: Always run tests after changes and fix failures before proposing edits.\n\nMock external dependencies with Jest mocks to isolate tests.\n\n## PR instructions\n\nFollow these guidelines for clean, reviewable pull requests. AI agents should simulate this workflow when suggesting changes.\n\n- **Pull Request Workflow**:\n  1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/ai-enhancement`.\n  2. Make changes, commit with semantic messages (e.g., `feat: add data validation`).\n  3. Run checks: `npm run lint && npm test && npm run build`.\n  4. Push and open PR: Link to issue if applicable (e.g., \"Closes #123\").\n\n- **Code Review Requirements**:\n  - All PRs require at least one approval.\n  - Checks: Linting passes, tests pass (80% coverage), no breaking changes.\n  - Self-review: Ensure code follows style guide; add tests for new features.\n  - AI Agent Tip: Include a summary of changes and rationale in PR description.\n\n- **Versioning**:\n  - Use Semantic Versioning (SemVer): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.\n  - Update `package.json` version on merge to main.\n  - Breaking changes: Increment MAJOR and add `CHANGELOG.md` entry.\n\n- **Release Process**:\n  1. Merge to main.\n  2. Tag release: `git tag v1.2.0 && git push --tags`.\n  3. Publish to npm: `npm publish` (requires credentials).\n  4. Update documentation (this AGENTS.md if workflows change).\n  - Automated releases via CI for minor/patch; manual for major.\n\nFor hotfixes, use `hotfix/` branches. Always squash commits before merging.\n\n---\n\n*Generated by [context-engine](https://github.com/luka-loehr/context-engine)*
