AGENTS.md is a special documentation file that provides instructions specifically for AI coding agents. Use clean, professional markdown formatting throughout. DO NOT repeat titles, add unprofessional footers, or include any meta-comments about the creation process.

IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:
- Start with exactly: "# [ProjectName] AGENTS.md" where [ProjectName] is the actual project name
- Follow immediately with a brief description paragraph (no title repetition)
- Use proper markdown hierarchy: # for main title, ## for sections
- Keep content concise and professional - avoid redundancy
- End with a clean footer: "---\n\n*Generated by [context-engine](https://github.com/luka-loehr/context-engine)*"
- Ensure clean, readable formatting without excessive line breaks

REQUIRED SECTIONS (in this exact order):

## Project Overview
Brief description of what this project does and its main purpose.

## Setup commands
Installation and development setup commands including:
- How to install dependencies
- How to start development servers

- Common development commands
- Build and deployment processes
- Environment setup requirements
- Troubleshooting tips
- Performance considerations

## Testing instructions
How to run tests and testing best practices including:
- Test commands
- Test structure and organization
- CI/CD setup
- Testing frameworks used
- Coverage requirements

## PR instructions
Guidelines for contributions and deployment including:

WORKFLOW:
1. Call statusUpdate with "Scanning project files"
2. Use getFileContent to explore key files - call statusUpdate with "Looking at project configuration" when reading config files
3. Call statusUpdate with "Examining source code structure" when looking at main files
4. Call statusUpdate with "Analyzing coding patterns and dependencies" when reviewing code
5. Call statusUpdate with "Reviewing project documentation" when reading docs
6. Call statusUpdate with "Compiling project overview" when ready to summarize
7. Call statusUpdate with "Creating AGENTS.md content" when starting to write the document
8. Call statusUpdate with "Saving AGENTS.md file" before using createFile tool

Use the statusUpdate tool at key milestones, not for every single file. Keep status messages brief and clear.

When calling createFile, you MUST include the successMessage parameter with a descriptive message like "AGENTS.md for [ProjectName] successfully created". This parameter is REQUIRED.

Use the getFileContent tool to explore files, statusUpdate to keep user informed, and createFile tool to write the final AGENTS.md when ready.`;
  }

  /**
   * Get the initial exploration prompt
   * @returns {string} Initial prompt
   */
  getInitialPrompt() {
    return `Please analyze this codebase and create a clean, professional AGENTS.md file. You MUST use the statusUpdate tool frequently to keep users informed - this is REQUIRED, not optional.

CRITICAL: Create a properly formatted AGENTS.md file with:
- Clean title: "# [ProjectName] AGENTS.md" (no repetition)
- Professional content only (no unprofessional footers or meta-comments)
- Proper markdown formatting
- Concise, non-redundant information

Start by calling statusUpdate with "Scanning project files", then examine key configuration files, documentation, and source code to understand the project structure, dependencies, and development workflow. Use statusUpdate at key milestones. Finally create a comprehensive AGENTS.md file following the standard format, and remember to include the REQUIRED successMessage parameter when calling createFile.`;
