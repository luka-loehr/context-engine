# Context Engine

Context Engine is an interactive AI-powered CLI tool that enables developers to chat with their codebase using XAI's Grok models. It analyzes project structure, provides instant code insights, and assists with development tasks through natural language conversations.

## Description

Context Engine transforms your codebase into an interactive AI assistant. By leveraging advanced language models, it understands your project's architecture, dependencies, and code patterns to deliver context-aware responses. Key use cases include:

- Explaining complex code sections
- Generating documentation from source files
- Debugging assistance through natural language queries
- Codebase navigation and architecture insights
- Refactoring suggestions based on project context

The tool supports multiple XAI Grok models and integrates seamlessly with existing development workflows.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16.0.0
- npm or yarn package manager
- XAI API key (obtain from [XAI Console](https://console.x.ai/))

### Installation Steps

1. **Install globally via npm:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @lukaloehr/context-engine
   ```

2. **Set up your XAI API key:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Environment variable
   export XAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   
   # Option 2: The tool will prompt for API key on first run
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   context --version
   ```

The post-install script will automatically configure the tool and check for updates.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Start interactive chat session (default)
context

# Chat with specific model
context --model grok-2

# Clear configuration and restart setup
context --clear-config

# Get help
context --help
```

### First-Time Setup

On first run, Context Engine will:
1. Prompt for your XAI API key
2. Select preferred model (defaults to 'context')
3. Configure project context scanning

### Interactive Chat

Once started, you can ask questions about your codebase:

```
> Explain the authentication flow in this project
> What does the user service handle?
> Show me the database schema
> How is error handling implemented?
```

The tool automatically analyzes your current directory and provides context-aware responses.

### Project Context

Context Engine scans your project to understand:
- File structure and dependencies
- Configuration files (package.json, .env, etc.)
- Key source files and modules
- Documentation and README content

Use `context --help` for all available options.
