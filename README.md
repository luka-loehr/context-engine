# Context Engine

Context Engine is an interactive AI-powered CLI tool that enables developers to chat with their codebase using XAI's Grok models. It provides instant answers, code analysis, and context-aware assistance directly from the command line.

## Description

Context Engine transforms your codebase into an interactive AI assistant. By analyzing your project files and structure, it allows you to ask questions about your code, get explanations, debug issues, and receive suggestions—all powered by advanced AI models from XAI.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language queries about your codebase
- Automatic project context analysis
- Support for multiple AI models
- Secure API key management
- Interactive chat sessions
- Syntax highlighting and formatted output

**Use Cases:**
- Understanding complex codebases
- Quick debugging and troubleshooting
- Code reviews and explanations
- Learning new projects
- Generating documentation

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js version 16.0.0 or higher
- An XAI API key (obtain from [x.ai](https://x.ai))

### Installation Steps

1. **Install globally via npm:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @lukaloehr/context-engine
   ```

2. **Set up your XAI API key:**
   Create a `.env` file in your home directory or set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export XAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Run the setup:**
   ```bash
   context setup
   ```
   This will guide you through model selection and configuration.

## Usage

### Basic Commands

- **Start interactive chat session:**
  ```bash
  context chat
  ```
  This analyzes your current project and starts an AI conversation.

- **Change AI model:**
  ```bash
  context model
  ```
  Select from available XAI models like Grok, Grok-1, etc.

- **Clear configuration:**
  ```bash
  context clear
  ```
  Reset all settings and start fresh.

### Example Usage

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

2. Start chatting with your code:
   ```bash
   context chat
   ```

3. Ask questions like:
   - "What does this function do?"
   - "How is the database connected?"
   - "Explain the authentication flow"
   - "Find bugs in the payment module"

The AI will analyze your codebase and provide detailed, context-aware responses.

### Project Context Analysis

Context Engine automatically scans your project to understand:
- File structure and dependencies
- Key configuration files
- Main entry points
- Common patterns and architecture

You can also specify a custom directory:
```bash
context chat /path/to/project
```

## Features

- **Multi-Model Support**: Choose from various XAI Grok models optimized for different tasks
- **Smart Context Gathering**: Automatically identifies relevant files and code patterns
- **Interactive Sessions**: Maintain conversation context across multiple questions
- **Secure Configuration**: Encrypted storage for API keys and settings
- **Rich Output Formatting**: Syntax-highlighted code and clear explanations
- **Update Notifications**: Automatic checks for new versions and features
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies with fast startup time
