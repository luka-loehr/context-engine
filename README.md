# Context Engine

Context Engine is an interactive AI-powered CLI tool that enables developers to chat with their codebase using advanced AI models like XAI Grok. It analyzes project structure, provides instant code insights, and assists with development tasks through natural language conversations.

## Description

Context Engine transforms your codebase into an interactive AI assistant. By combining sophisticated prompt engineering with AI language models, it allows you to ask questions about your code, get explanations, debug issues, and receive suggestions directly from the command line.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language interaction with your entire codebase
- Support for multiple AI models (XAI Grok, OpenAI, and more)
- Intelligent context gathering and token optimization
- Syntax-highlighted code responses
- Persistent configuration and session management
- Update notifications and easy model switching

**Use Cases:**
- Understanding complex legacy codebases
- Quick code reviews and explanations
- Debugging assistance through conversational AI
- Learning new projects by asking questions
- Generating documentation from code analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js version 16.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- API key for your preferred AI provider (XAI, OpenAI, etc.)

### Install via npm
```bash
npm install -g @lukaloehr/context-engine
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
context --version
```

The tool will automatically run a post-install script to set up necessary configurations.

## Usage

### Initial Setup
The first time you run the tool, it will guide you through setup:

```bash
context
```

You'll be prompted to:
1. Select your preferred AI model (default: context)
2. Enter your API key (stored securely)
3. Choose your default project directory

### Basic Commands

**Start a chat session in current directory:**
```bash
context chat
```

**Chat with a specific project:**
```bash
context chat /path/to/your/project
```

**Switch AI models:**
```bash
context model
```

**Clear configuration (reset setup):**
```bash
context clear
```

**View help:**
```bash
context --help
```

### Interactive Chat Session
Once started, you can ask questions like:
- "Explain how the authentication system works"
- "What does this function do?"
- "Find all API endpoints in the codebase"
- "Suggest improvements for this React component"
- "Debug why this test is failing"

The AI will analyze your codebase context and provide detailed, syntax-highlighted responses.

### Environment Variables
Set your API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export XAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# or for OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
```

## Features

- **Multi-Model Support**: Seamlessly switch between XAI Grok, OpenAI GPT models, and other providers
- **Intelligent Context Gathering**: Automatically analyzes your project structure and relevant files
- **Token Optimization**: Smart prompt engineering to maximize response quality within token limits
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Beautiful, colored code output using highlight.js
- **Persistent Configuration**: Securely stores API keys and preferences using Conf
- **Update Notifications**: Automatic checks for new versions
- **CLI-First Design**: Built with Commander.js for intuitive command-line interface
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend with custom models or features
